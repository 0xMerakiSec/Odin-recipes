    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the Lasagna Noodles:

        <p>Fill a large pot with water, add a pinch of salt, and bring it to a boil.
        Add the lasagna noodles and cook according to the package instructions until they're al dente.
        Drain and set aside.</p></li>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce:

        <p>In a large skillet or pan, heat some olive oil over medium heat.
        Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.
        Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute until fragrant.
        Add the ground meat and cook until it's browned and crumbled.
        Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper.
        Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing it to thicken. If you want some heat, you can add red pepper
        flakes to taste.</p></li>
        <li>Make Béchamel Sauce:

        <p>In a separate saucepan, melt some butter over medium heat.
        Stir in an equal amount of all-purpose flour to create a roux.
        Slowly add milk while continuously whisking to avoid lumps.
        Keep whisking until the sauce thickens to a creamy consistency.
        Season the béchamel sauce with salt and pepper.</p></li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna:

        <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
        In a baking dish, start with a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom to prevent sticking.
        Layer with lasagna noodles.
        Add a layer of meat sauce, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce, ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella, and
        grated Parmesan. Repeat this layering process.
        Continue layering until you've used all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous
        amount of cheese on top.</p></li>
        <li>Bake:

        <p>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.
        Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and golden brown.</p></li>
        <li>Serve:

        <p>Allow the lasagna to rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</p></li>
